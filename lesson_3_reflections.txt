1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Pretty well always, if doing work one does not want to lose, as hard drives have a way 
of failing at the worst . . . I can't . . . the memories are too raw & bitter

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- if you are open source, someone else may make changes to the repository on GitHub that
you will want to vet before pulling them to your machine. Automated syncing is just scary.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

- A fork is the creation of a copy of a project within GitHub; use this when we want a 
copy of a project's files to play with and alter on our own. Clone is a copy of a repository 
either from remote to local machine, or within local; use this to create a new project 
based on exising code. A branch is a subsidiary history of commits which may or may not
be merged into the master branch, but tend toward that destiny.
