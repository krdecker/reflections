1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Pretty well always, if doing work one does not want to lose, as hard drives have a way 
of failing at the worst . . . I can't . . . the memories are too raw & bitter

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- if you are open source, someone else may make changes to the repository on GitHub that
you will want to vet before pulling them to your machine. Automated syncing is just scary.
