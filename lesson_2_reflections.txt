1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- a .git folder is created to hold commit meta-data; need this to get ready 
to do commits

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

- staging area is a selection of files that have been changed and are to be 
grouped into a commit. This allows flexibility to do separate commits based on 
logic of the changes.
